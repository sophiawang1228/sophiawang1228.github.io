> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.[1][2] DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology[(Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)


According to this definition, there are sets of tools developed for this purpose, namely "toolchains". These toolchains more or less fall in one of the seven categories. 

- Coding: writting and reviewing code | version control tools (GitHub)

- Building: continuous integration, automated build | pipelines (Gitlab/GitBucket)

- Testing: continuous testing, providing timely feedback | Eggplant,Tricentis

- Packaging: artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.

- Releasing: change management, release approval, release automation

- Configuring: infrastructure configuring management, infrastructure as code | Terraform, Ansible, Puppet

- Monitoring: application performance monitoring, end user monitoring

So in the end, as a developer or employee, DevOps is a set of principles and tools that guides the collaboration between a team of developers. It enables a fast and reliable developing process that can save a lot of time, or equivalently means money for the company.
