 > In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable [(Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

## SOLID Principles:

- Single-Responsibility Principle:
	- Every class should have only one responsibility
- Open-Closed Principle:
	- software entities... should be open for extension, closed for modification
- Listkov Substitution Principle:
	- objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- Interface Segregation Principle:
	-many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle:
	-depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

## Design Pattern

> A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander[1] and has been adapted for various other disciplines, notably software engineering [(Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)

- Creational Patterns: create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way

	- Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

	- Factory: Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

	- Singleton: Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

	- Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.

	- Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
	-
- Structural Patterns: focus on class and objects, inheritance/API
	- Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.

	- Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.
