#### 977 Squares of a Sorted Array[https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/]
Only thought of square + sort , complexity is O(n+logn)
Could also be done using Two pointers. Given
that the original list is sorted, we let i = 0, j = n-1, k = n-1.
while K < 0, we assign the bigger of i^2 and j^2 to 
the k position in answer array

#### 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum
1. Finished using sum(),  TLE
2. Stucked on two pointer iterations.  Key difference is in the
the order between checking limits and taking sum
